# 🌱 Smart Fertilizer Recommendation System

**AGRICURE = Productivity + Profit + Planet**  

An IoT-powered, AI/ML-driven system that provides **real-time, precise, and crop-specific fertilizer recommendations** to farmers. Our goal is to **boost yields, lower costs, and ensure sustainable farming** — all through data-driven, location-aware insights.  

---

## 🚜 Problem Statement

Farmers often lack **accurate information** about the quality and quantity of fertilizers required for their crops.  
This leads to:

- Nutrient imbalance in soils
- Reduced crop yield and soil degradation
- Environmental pollution from excess fertilizer use
- Rising production costs (~18% for small farmers)
- Inefficient farming practices causing economic losses

> **Fact:** Over 40–60% of applied nitrogen and phosphorus never reaches plants — it pollutes waterways or escapes as greenhouse gases.

## 💡 Solution Overview

The **Smart Fertilizer Recommendation System** integrates **IoT sensors + Machine Learning** to deliver **real-time advisory** to farmers.

1. IoT Sensors measure soil NPK, moisture, pH, temperature, and humidity.
2. ML algorithms compare real-time readings with ideal crop requirements.
3. The system outputs the exact fertilizer type and quantity needed.

**Key Benefits**:
- Boost yield by 20–30%  
- Reduce input costs via precision delivery  
- Promote climate-smart, sustainable practices
